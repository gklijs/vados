## Introduction

This project will make it possible to quickly generate html files based on some file structure. It's main use case is to
make it simple to have a blog/log which can be easily maintained, having most of the content in markdown files. I create
this mainly to scratch my own itch and for learning. The scope can easily grow out of control, so I probably only add
things I would use myself. At this point it's much WIP, where braking changes can be expected. The name is based on that
it assumes [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) is assumed for the css. The generator is likely fast, and Bulma is also a
character in
[Dragon Ball Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z). So I looked
for [fast Dragon Ball Z characters](https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-fastest-characters-ranked/) and thus ended up with
[Vados](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Vados). As it turns out she can also easily destroy and recreate planets,
which is kind of what this project does as well.
